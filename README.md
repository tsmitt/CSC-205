# CSC-205
Computer Organization Final Project
The final project for my Computer Organization (CSC 205) course at Northern Virginia Community College. 
With this assignment, we were asked to write a program that would take any ASCII value as input and 
evaluate its binary representation. The first of three outputs displayed the binary representation of 
the ASCII value. The second represented the number of 1's in that binary representation. The third would 
either be a 0 or 1 depending on the partiality of the binary. If a partial was spotted the bit was 
toggled. All code was written in assembly language.
